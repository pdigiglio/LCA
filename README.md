Description
===========================

This repository contains my C++ source code for simulating an Anti-Ferromagnetic quantum spin lattice in one dimension (i.e. a spin chain).

The main function is located in "reticolo_2d.cpp" while "global.h" contains chain parameters like inverse temperature B,
exchange coupling coefficient J, number of spin sites N and doubled Trotter number M.
