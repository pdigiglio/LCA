Description
===========================

This repository contains my C++ source code for simulating an Anti-Ferromagnetic quantum spin lattice in one dimension (i.e. a spin __chain__) at low temperatures.
The algorithm is based on the Anti-Ferromagnetic Heisenberg Model, which is __sperimentally__ prooved to describe the physical system.

under the supervision of professor [M. Pepe] [1].

Purpose
------------

The aim of the project is to evaluate staggered susceptivity, uniform susceptivity and linear energy density of the spin chain.


Code
-----------------

The main routine for generating data (measures) is stored in *reticolo_2d.** files, which need also *global.h* header to be included.
A very simple *Makefile* is also given, which allows to compile the main program with the `gcc` suite (please, set your own compile flags since specific options such as `-march=core2` are selected).
It also tries to automatically detect your machine architeture and suggests you the best `-march=` flag option.


The `main()` function is located in *reticolo_2d.cpp*; class `Reticolo` is defined and implemented in *reticolo_2d.h* and *reticolo_2d.cc*, respectively.
The header *global.h* contains chain parameters like inverse temperature *B*,
exchange coupling coefficient *J*, number of spin sites *N* and doubled Trotter number *M*.
This file is supposed to be dinamically generated by *analisi.sh*, a bash-script that automatizes data generation, analysis and plotting (with [GNUplot] [2]).


I apoologize for code comments are in Italian only.

Data analysis
---------

In the *.cc* file some functions such as `Reticolo::media()` are defined, that allows to calculate mean and Standard Deviation of Mean (SDM).
However, the *analisi.cpp* contains tools for binning data contained in *data.dat* (created by execution of *./reticolo_2d*) in cluster of variable size _d_ and study them as function of _d_.
Every line of *data.dat* is expected to be formatted as `"%f, %f, %f\n"` to be correctly read by *analisi*.

[todo]
As soon as I can, I will provide a [ROOT] [3] macro for fitting plots.
