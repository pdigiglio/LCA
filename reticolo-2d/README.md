General
=====================

In this repository are stored source code for the *bi-dimensional* version of [this] [1] one.


Since bi-dimensional lattice numerical simluation requires higher computational time, the plaque detecting function of this version is _slightly_ better in relation to mono-dimensional one.

<!---
All the functions are nearly the same as in mono-dimensional implementation except for plaque detecting.
Indeed, spin chain simulation has been written in such a way to allow bi-dimensional lattice generalization quite as simply as possible.
