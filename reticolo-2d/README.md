General
=====================

In this sub-directory are stored source code files for the *bi-dimensional* version of [mono-dimensional spin chain] [1].


Since bi-dimensional lattice numerical simluation requires higher computational time, the plaque detecting function of this version is _slightly_ better in relation to mono-dimensional one.

<!---
All the functions are nearly the same as in mono-dimensional implementation except for plaque detecting.
Indeed, spin chain simulation has been written in such a way to allow bi-dimensional lattice generalization quite as simply as possible.
