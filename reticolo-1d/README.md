Description
===========================

This sub-directory contains my C++ source code for simulating an Anti-Ferromagnetic quantum spin lattice in one dimension (i.e. a spin __chain__) at low temperatures.
<!---
The algorithm is based on the Anti-Ferromagnetic Heisenberg Model, which is __sperimentally__ prooved to describe the physical system.


This work is mostly based on the studies of [Wiese-Ying] [4], who first adapted the Loop Cluster Algorithm (LCA) to spin lattices.
Another useful reference is [Beard] [5] Ph.D. thesis, which exhaustively explains the alorithm details and extends it to continuum limit.


There are two different and equivalent implementations of LCA:
* __Single-cluster__
in which one loop at time is constructed and all the spin in it are flipped;
* __Multi-cluster__
in which the lattice is fully covered with loops that are randomly flipped with 50% of probability.

This project is build upon the latter.

Purpose
------------

The aim of the project is to evaluate staggered susceptivity, uniform susceptivity and linear energy density of the spin chain.


Code
-----------------

The main routine for generating data (measures) is stored in _reticolo-1d.*_ files, which need also *global.h* header to be included.
A very simple _Makefile_ is also given, which allows to compile the main program with the `gcc` suite (please, set your own compile flags since specific options such as `-march=core2` are selected).
It also tries to automatically detect your machine architeture and suggests you the best `-march=` flag option.


The `main()` function is located in _reticolo-1d.cpp_; class `Reticolo` is defined and implemented in _reticolo-1d.h_ and *reticolo-1d.cc*, respectively.
The header *global.h* contains chain parameters like inverse temperature *B*,
exchange coupling coefficient *J*, number of spin sites *N* and doubled Trotter number *M*.
This file is supposed to be dinamically generated by *analisi.sh*, a bash-script that automatizes data generation, analysis and plotting (with [GNUplot] [2]).

### Some notes

Although the plaque detecting function in this implementation is _slightly_ slower than the two-dimensional one, it's not worth upgrading it since the algorithm is quite fast anyway.
